The Cricket as a Thermometer
Crickets are cold-blooded and take on the temperature of their surroundings. Back in 1897, a scientist named Amos Dolbear published an article “The Cricket as a Thermometer” that noted the correlation between the ambient temperature and the rate at which crickets chirp.

The insects’ muscles contract to produce chirping, based on chemical reactions. The warmer the temperature, the easier the cricket’s muscles activate, so the chirps increase. The cooler the temerpature, the slower the reaction rate, and the less frequent the chirps.

Did you know you can determine the temperature outside by counting the number of chirps the cricket makes? Just count the number of chirps one makes in 25 seconds and place the number in the box below in the app.
